Alarm is not properly reported.

strongDebounce is OK

For moustrap and pwr this output must be reported in SMS
1) dummyflag must be replaced:
	musTrpAlarmFlg
	mainPwrAlarmFlg
2) These flags must be set on return from strongDebounce

3) New flags must be reported. New report:
    xxAlm: new(NEW ALARM (as is)) cur: xxxAlarmFlg

Remember to put ElAlm om separate line!

PowerAlarmen vises bare en gang.
Jeg trakk ut støpslet for å teste 29/9.
Fikk en alarm, men glemte å sette støpslet.
Den 9/9 var batteriet helt tomt - ingen flere meldinger!
Omfattende jobb for å få igang igjen et fullstendig tømt batteri.
 - men også kunnskap om at batteriet holder
   Batterikapasitet nominelt 30Ahr holdt i 10 dager,
   forbruket er altså ca:
    30 Ahr*12V/(10dgr*24[hr/dgr])hr=1,5AV dvs 1,5W
    eller ca 125mA strøm

The alarm was moved to Hyttun and worked well.
Than on the 17/12 it stopped sending SMS. (That is approx.
100 days after I powered it up?)
I went down to the Hyttun and the display showed repeted "running lights" which indicates that the nr. of SMS's has been exceeded.

The unit was powered down and up again. Everything seems to work fine.

>>>  The counter should be reset in setup() to make sure that it is
sett correctly when the reset btn is pressed.
